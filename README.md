# playoffRankings
<h3>For which sports do rankings most accurately predict champions?</h3>

A side project examining for which sports are top-seeded teams most likely to win the championship.<br>
Really just a good way of practicing web scraping (Python), data analysis (R), and web coding (D3, HTML, CSS).<br>
<br>

<b>scrape.py:</b> Scrape data for all sports from different sites <br>
<b>analysis.R:</b> Clean and reshape data, do some anaylsis<br>
<b>index.html:</b> Throw it all together on a webpage<br>
<b>sankey.js:</b> D3 package for building sankey charts, used for data visualization<br>
